# Intro

## Single dataset

### Population
all instances of data, all objects of a given problem
### Sample
subset of population
### Mean
Average value, add all numbers and divide by the size
### Median
Value in the middle, when all values are sorted. If size is odd, find mean of two middle values
### Mode
most frequent values in the dataset, can be many: bimodal, multimodal, etc.
### Variance
Measure of spread of the dataset, similar to standard deviation but square of S
### Standard Deviation(S)
Measure of spread of the dataset, gives intuition of how similar the values are

## Two datasets
### Covariance
Show if there is a dependence(connection) between datasets
* can be positive and negative: if first dataset goes up, does second go up or down?
* only sign matters, does not express scale of connection
### Correlation
